    Dinosaurs were a<span class="redtext">This is a span</span> diverse group of reptiles that dominated Earth for more than 160 million years, long before humans appeared. They first emerged during the Triassic period, around 230 million years ago, and quickly spread across the planet, evolving into a stunning variety of shapes and sizes. Some were small and swift, no bigger than a chicken, while others—like Argentinosaurus—were massive, stretching over 100 feet long and weighing as much as dozens of elephants. Dinosaurs adapted to nearly every environment on Earth, from dense forests to open plains, making them one of the most successful groups of animals in history.

Scientists generally divide dinosaurs into two major groups based on their hip structure: saurischians and ornithischians. Saurischians include the enormous long-necked sauropods and the fierce theropods, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor. Ornithischians, on the other hand, include armored dinosaurs like Ankylosaurus, horned species like Triceratops, and duck-billed hadrosaurs. Their impressive diversity meant they filled countless ecological roles—herbivores grazing on ancient plants, predators hunting prey, and even some species that may have lived in herds for protection.

<p class="purpletext">One of the most fascinating developments in dinosaur research is the discovery that many dinosaurs were more closely related to modern birds than to reptiles. In fact, birds are now considered living dinosaurs—a surviving lineage of small, feathered theropods. This connection has reshaped how scientists imagine dinosaur behavior, suggesting that some species may have been warm-blooded, cared for their young, and even used feathers for display or insulation.</p>

<br>Dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago, likely due to a massive asteroid impact combined with volcanic activity and global climate changes. Despite their disappearance, they continue to capture human imagination. From fossil discoveries that reveal new species each year to movies and museum displays that bring them to life, dinosaurs remain one of the most captivating subjects in science—reminding us of Earth’s deep history and the incredible forms life can take.</br>
